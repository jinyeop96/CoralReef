1. Create a component ( A component has .html and .ts for displaying and business logic for the view only.)
    This is for a single page
-> ng generate component components/<new component name>

2. run the web
 -> ng serve
 -> go to any web browser, and localhost:4200

3. git 
 -> You must create a new branch from main branch. This will copy everything to the new branch.
        -> git branch : check all the branches and current branch
        -> git branch <new branch name> : create a new branch
        -> git checkout <branch name> : move on to the branch
    Develop as you go.
    git pull from the remote repository before git push from the new branch.
    After that, go to GitHub, click pull request. This will check for conflict. 
    If no problem, merge with the main source code.

    After that, checkout to main branch (git checkout main)
    then you must pull from remote repository (git pull).
    
    Finally, remove the branch used. (git branch -d <branch name>)

    **Repeat this process every time you want to develop**
    
    *** If you pull and push from main branch, we all will encounter conflict and delay the process. ***
